java-sample-code
================

The project ExampleCode contains sample code in java.

The code is structured in 5 packages:
 
1) illustratingOOP - This package contains 4 classes, 1 abstract class and 1 interface.It's purpose is to 
illustrate the main OOP principles -Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphism.Some examples
are shown in the main method

2) mianPackage - it has 1 class in it - TryExamples, and it contains the main method and a lot of other 
methods.In the main method there are examples, which can be tweaked to test the solutions.

3) myImplementationsOfSomeAbstractDataStructures - it contains 2 dynamic implementations of abstract structures
that i created, first - Doubly Linked List, and the second - of Stack.They are tested in the main method

4) someAlgorithms - contains a class called Algorithms with implementations of 2 sorting algorithms and binary
search.Tested in main method.

5) someStringExamples - contains a class, which is an implementation of a String, and has some methods for
manipulation.It is nothing different from the basic String class, the main method just became too big so I 
decided to put this out of it.
