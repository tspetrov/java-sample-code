Looking for houses was supposed to be a fun and exciting process.Unfortunately, none of the ones
that we saw seemed to match the specifications that we had established. They were too small, 
too impersonal, too close to the neighbors. After days of finding nothing even close, 
we began to wonder: was there really a perfect house out there for us?
